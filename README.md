NHL game- and player-related data scraper
=========================

The script load_stats.py can be used to fetch game data for teams and players using the public API provided by the NHL. See main function for example usage.

The script rocket_richard_simulation.py contains an example of simulations determining which player will win the Rocket Richard trophy (most goals scored in regular season), by using the historical goal scoring data of each player as the basis for simulating how much goals the players score in the remaining games.
